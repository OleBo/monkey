# MoNKey!

## Goal
The goal for this project is to support two-player sessions of m,n,k,p,q-games
through a web interface developed using Google App Engine as the framework.

## m,n,k,p,q-game?
From Wikipedia:

> An `m`,`n`,`k`-game is an abstract board game in which two players take turns
> in placing a stone of their color on an `m`Ã—`n` board, the winner being the
> player who first gets `k` stones of their own color in a row, horizontally,
> vertically, or diagonally. Thus, tic-tac-toe is the 3,3,3-game and free-style
> gomoku is the 19,19,5-game.

The p and q variables were introduced to support Connect6. From Connect6.org:

> Black plays first and puts only `q` black stone on `q` unoccupied
> intersections (also called grids). Subsequently, Black and White alternately
> put `p` of their own stones on `p` unoccupied grids.
